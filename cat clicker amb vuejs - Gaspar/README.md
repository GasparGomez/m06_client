# Cat Clicker

## The application should display
- a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
- an area to display the selected cat

## In the cat display area, the following should be displayed
- the cat's name
- a picture of the cat
- text showing the number of clicks

## The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.
# Interaction
- When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
- The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
